				<p>Journalism and Mass Communication tackles the ways in which ideas are exchanged in modern society. Students learn how to find factual information and communicate that through styles of writing, speech, multimedia tools, such as online platforms. Students interested in current events, reading, writing, research, and working for news reporting and communication platforms should opt for journalism and mass communications. Careers in news reporting, public relations, television, and advertising are some of the future options under this subject. <br><br>

Courses within Journalism and Mass Communication at Thames are offered under the School of Social Sciences. With exposure to writing programs, involvement in the college magazine, social media, and blog, as well as internship opportunities within the journalistic and communications field, students under this school are exposed to a range of work experience and hands-on learning.</p>
